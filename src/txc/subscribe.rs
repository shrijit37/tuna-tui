//! The TXC subscriber: read NDJSON off the theme socket, forever.
//!
//! This is the consumer half of the protocol. It is deliberately the smallest
//! thing that is *correct*, because every bug this module avoids is one that
//! ships in a real client today.
//!
//! ## Why the framing is [`BufRead::read_line`] and nothing else
//!
//! The obvious implementation — `read()` into a `[u8; N]`, split on `\n` —
//! is wrong, and wrong in a way that only shows up under load. A socket read
//! returns *whatever bytes have arrived*, not a message. A `ThemeEvent` is
//! ~900 bytes of JSON; the moment the publisher's write is split across TCP-
//! or Unix-domain-buffer boundaries, the naive client sees half a JSON object,
//! fails to parse it, and drops a palette (or worse, resynchronizes on the
//! wrong newline). `hyprland-rs` has exactly this bug in its event client.
//!
//! [`BufRead::read_line`] is the fix and costs nothing: it owns the partial-
//! line buffer and blocks until a full line is available. Every read in this
//! module goes through it. See `message_split_across_two_writes_still_parses`.
//!
//! ## Why unknown messages are skipped, not fatal
//!
//! [`Message`] is a closed enum, so a future `{"t":"nowplaying",...}` line is
//! a hard deserialization error — which would kill the stream for a v1 client
//! that has no business caring about a message type invented after it shipped.
//!
//! Rather than pattern-match serde's error *text* (brittle, and it changes
//! between serde releases), this module pre-parses each line into a tiny
//! [`Envelope`] carrying only `t` and `v`. That single cheap pass answers both
//! forward-compatibility questions up front:
//!
//! - `t` is not one of [`KNOWN_TAGS`] → skip the line, keep reading.
//! - `v` is greater than [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] → we are structurally unable to
//!   trust the payload, so surface an error instead of silently misreading it
//!   (spec: a major bump means a token was removed, renamed, or reframed).
//!
//! Unknown *fields* need no handling at all: [`wire`](crate::txc::wire)
//! intentionally omits `deny_unknown_fields`, and this module must never add
//! it.
//!
//! ## Why `watch` backs off
//!
//! Tuna TUI is a music player; it restarts, and it may not be running when the
//! consumer starts. A bar or prompt daemon that reconnects in a tight loop
//! burns a core for as long as Tuna TUI is closed. [`watch`] therefore retries with
//! capped exponential backoff — fast enough that a Tuna TUI restart is visually
//! instant, slow enough that "Tuna TUI is not installed" costs nothing.
