//! WCAG contrast math and the `on_*` foreground picker.
//!
//! ## The sRGB gamma decode
//!
//! An 8-bit channel value is **not** light. sRGB stores color pre-encoded with
//! a ~2.2 gamma curve so that the limited 256 steps are spent where human
//! vision is most sensitive (the darks). Averaging or comparing those encoded
//! bytes directly — the `(r+g+b)/3 > 128` heuristic every theming project
//! reaches for first — measures *storage*, not *brightness*, and mis-ranks
//! saturated colors badly.
//!
//! So each channel is first normalized to `0.0..=1.0` and then linearized:
//!
//! ```text
//! c_lin = c <= 0.03928 ? c / 12.92 : ((c + 0.055) / 1.055) ^ 2.4
//! ```
//!
//! The low branch is a linear toe: the pure power function has an infinite
//! slope at zero, which is numerically nasty and would require impractical
//! precision near black, so the standard splices a straight segment in below
//! the knee. Above it, the offset-power curve is the actual inverse of the
//! sRGB transfer function.
//!
//! The linear channels are then weighted by the luminous efficiency of the
//! CIE Y primaries — `0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B`. Green dominates because
//! the human eye is roughly ten times more sensitive to it than to blue, which
//! is why a saturated blue that "looks bright" is in fact a dark background.
//!
//! ## Why the protocol publishes this, not the consumer
//!
//! TXC exists so a subscriber can paint itself from Tuna TUI's album-derived
//! palette. If each consumer computed its own `is_dark` and its own foreground
//! choice, three things would go wrong:
//!
//! 1. **They'd disagree.** A bar using a naive average and a prompt using WCAG
//!    would pick opposite foregrounds for the same palette, and the desktop
//!    would visibly desynchronize on borderline album art.
//! 2. **They'd mostly be wrong.** Skipping the gamma decode is the common case
//!    in the wild (spec §3.3); it is a silent accessibility bug, not a crash.
//! 3. **It isn't their job.** Tuna TUI already knows the exact palette and its
//!    provenance. Shipping the derived answer is cheaper on the wire than a
//!    hex triple's worth of ambiguity, and it makes correctness a
//!    one-implementation problem.
//!
//! Hence [`Contrast`] rides in every `ThemeEvent` alongside the raw tokens:
//! consumers that care can recompute, but nobody *has* to.
