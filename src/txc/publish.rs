//! The publisher half of TXC: a Unix socket that fans one palette out to
//! however many subscribers happen to be listening — including none.
//!
//! [`mod@crate::txc`] defines *what* goes on the wire. This module owns *how*
//! it gets there, and every design decision below exists to protect one
//! invariant:
//!
//! > **Publishing color must never be able to stall playback.**
//!
//! Tuna TUI is a music player first. A subscriber is an untrusted, unprivileged
//! stranger that Tuna TUI never asked for and cannot audit; it may be a shell
//! script that connects and then blocks on a `read` forever. If a wedged
//! consumer could apply back-pressure to the audio/UI thread, TXC would be a
//! liability rather than a feature. So the publisher is *structurally*
//! incapable of blocking:
//!
//! - [`Publisher::publish`] only ever calls [`SyncSender::try_send`]. It has
//!   no blocking call in it at all — not on the socket, not on a channel.
//! - Every peer owns a **bounded** queue ([`PEER_QUEUE`] slots) and a
//!   dedicated writer thread. The writer thread is the only code that touches
//!   the socket, so all the blocking lives out there where it is harmless.
//! - A full queue is not something to wait on, it is a verdict: that
//!   subscriber is too slow, and it gets **dropped**. Lagging is the
//!   consumer's problem, and it is a detectable one — `seq` is
//!   per-connection, so a reconnecting client sees `seq` restart at `0` and
//!   knows it missed frames.
//!
//! ## Why a socket rather than a FIFO
//!
//! A FIFO has exactly one reader; a second `cat` steals bytes from the first.
//! `UnixListener` gives each subscriber an independent byte stream, which is
//! what makes fan-out — and therefore per-connection `seq` and
//! snapshot-on-connect — possible at all.
//!
//! ## Snapshot on connect
//!
//! A subscriber that starts mid-track must not have to wait for the next song
//! to paint itself. So the first line on every accepted connection is a
//! complete `theme` message with `seq: 0` carrying current state, published
//! from inside the same lock that registers the peer — so a `publish` racing
//! an `accept` can neither duplicate nor skip a frame for that peer.
//!
//! If nothing has been published yet there *is* no current state. The
//! connection is held open and silent rather than being fed a fabricated
//! palette: a consumer painting itself with a fake theme for one frame is a
//! visible bug, whereas a brief wait is invisible.
